# Go Forum release announcement draft notes

## Task
#98: Write Go Forum release announcement.

## Inputs used
- `docs/research/2026-02-09-project-awareness-publishing-channels.md` section on Go Forum Releases structure.
- Existing project messaging from README and `docs/launch/show-hn.md`.

## Drafting decisions
- Followed requested structure: what it does, why built, value vs alternatives, install, quickstart.
- Emphasized:
  - Go-native binary distribution
  - multi-agent-safe primitives (`pick --claim`, claim expiry)
  - file-based/git-native workflow
  - token-efficient compact output for agent loops
- Kept tone informative and practical for the Releases category.

## Output
- Draft post created at `docs/launch/go-forum-release.md`.
