# Release research: v0.23.0 notes preparation

Date: 2026-02-09

## Scope
Prepared release inputs by comparing `v0.22.0..HEAD`.

## Commands used
- `git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -n 10`
- `git log v0.22.0..HEAD --oneline`
- `git diff v0.22.0..HEAD --stat`

## Findings
- Latest released tag before this release: `v0.22.0`.
- Work since `v0.22.0` is primarily test coverage expansion across `cmd/`, `e2e/`, `internal/board/`, `internal/config/`, `internal/output/`, and `internal/task/`.
- User-facing functional addition identified in commits:
  - `feat: add E2E coverage integration with GOCOVERDIR`
- Aggregate diff stats observed:
  - 16 files changed
  - 4417 insertions
  - 35 deletions

## Release-note direction
- Emphasize higher confidence and better regression protection due to broad unit/e2e test additions.
- Call out new E2E coverage integration with practical usage examples.
- Keep upgrading guidance simple: no manual migration expected.
