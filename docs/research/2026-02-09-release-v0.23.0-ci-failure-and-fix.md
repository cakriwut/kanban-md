# Release research: v0.23.0 CI failure and fix

Date: 2026-02-09

## Context
Attempted release via tag push `v0.23.0`.

## What happened
- Release workflow run: `21820623113`
- Outcome: failed before goreleaser stage
- Failing jobs:
  - `ci (windows-latest)`
  - `ci (macos-latest)`
- `gh release view v0.23.0` returned `release not found`.

## Root cause
New tests added in the latest commits asserted POSIX-style paths and failed on non-POSIX separators.

Observed failures:
- `cmd/skill_extended_test.go:107`
  - got `skills\\SKILL.md`, expected `skills/SKILL.md`
- `internal/config/config_extended_test.go:33`
  - got `\\tmp\\kanban\\cards`, expected `/tmp/kanban/cards`

## Fix applied locally
- Updated test expectations to use `filepath.Join(...)` and OS-native path handling:
  - `cmd/skill_extended_test.go`
  - `internal/config/config_extended_test.go`

## Validation
- Focused tests:
  - `go test ./cmd -run 'TestRelativePath_Simple|TestRelativePath_SamePath'` -> pass
  - `go test ./internal/config -run 'TestTasksPath|TestTasksPath_CustomDir'` -> pass
- Full suite:
  - `go test ./...` -> pass
- Lint:
  - `golangci-lint run ./...` could not run locally (`command not found`)

## Next step to complete release
A commit containing the above test fixes is required before cutting a new release tag.
