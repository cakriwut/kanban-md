#   frost-maple: `pick` — atomic find + claim + move (recommended)
#   amber-swift: two-step claim-in-place then move
#   coral-dusk:  single-step move with --claim

# frost-maple picks the highest-priority unclaimed task (the critical
# security fix) and moves it to in-progress in one atomic step.
