# Guidelines

- Use semantic commit format, e.g.

```
feat: <short description>

Detailed description of the changes, that can be multiline, but do not artificially create line breaks, as commit messages are automatically wrapped.
- Use bullet points
- When needed
```

- When making changes that affect user-facing behavior (new commands, new flags, changed defaults, new installation methods, etc.), update `README.md` to reflect those changes.
