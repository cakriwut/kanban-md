# Guidelines

- Use semantic commit format, e.g.

```
feat: <short description>

Detailed description of the changes, that can be multiline, but do not artificially create line breaks, as commit messages are automatically wrapped.
- Use bullet points
- When needed
```

- When making changes that affect user-facing behavior (new commands, new flags, changed defaults, new installation methods, etc.), update `README.md` to reflect those changes.

- Whenever any research is done (including by the subagents), it should be documented as a report in docs/research/YYYY-MM-DD-<description>.md. In case of subagents, the need to be instructed to create the report file and on completion return only the path to the report, so that the main agent can read and analyze it.

## Releasing

To release a new version, tag and push. The release workflow triggers automatically on tag push — do NOT also run `gh workflow run release`, as that causes a duplicate build.

```
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin main --tags
```

## Backward Compatibility

When modifying `config.yml` schema or task file frontmatter, you must ensure backward compatibility:

### Config changes

1. **Bump `CurrentVersion`** in `internal/config/defaults.go`.
2. **Add a migration function** in `internal/config/migrate.go` that transforms the old format to the new one. Register it in the `migrations` map. The migration must increment `cfg.Version`.
3. **Create a new fixture directory** at `internal/config/testdata/compat/vN/` (where N is the OLD version number) with a representative `config.yml` and sample task files. Copy from the previous version's fixtures before making changes.
4. **Add a compat test** in `internal/config/compat_test.go` that loads the old fixture with the current code and verifies all fields parse correctly after migration.

### Task file changes

- **Adding new optional fields** with `omitempty` is always safe -- old files without the field parse correctly (zero value).
- **Never rename or remove existing fields.** If a field must change, keep the old YAML tag and add the new one, or handle it in a migration.
- When adding new task fields, add a fixture file in `internal/task/testdata/compat/v1/tasks/` that exercises the field (or create a new version directory if the format changes).
- Add a compat test in `internal/task/compat_test.go` verifying the field parses correctly from fixtures.

### Testing

- Run `go test -run Compat ./internal/config/ ./internal/task/` to verify backward compatibility.
- Compat tests must pass for ALL previous fixture versions, not just the latest.

## Output Format Design

The default output is **table**. TTY auto-detection was intentionally removed — agents run in non-TTY environments and were getting verbose JSON by default, wasting tokens and context window.

Three formats are available:
- **table** (default): Human-readable padded columns. Best for interactive terminal use.
- **compact** (`--compact`/`--oneline` or `KANBAN_OUTPUT=compact`): One-line-per-record format modeled after `git log --oneline`. ~70% fewer tokens than JSON. Designed for AI agent consumption.
- **json** (`--json` or `KANBAN_OUTPUT=json`): Full structured JSON. Use for scripting and piping to `jq`.

This is a deliberate design decision. Do not revert to TTY auto-detection without understanding the agent token cost implications. See `docs/research/2026-02-08-token-efficient-output-formats.md` for the research behind this choice.

## Using the Kanban Board

This project uses its own kanban board (in `kanban/`) to track work. Use the CLI to manage tasks as you work.

### Workflow

1. **Before starting work**, check the board:
   ```
   go run . list
   go run . list --status backlog
   ```

2. **When picking up a task**, move it to in-progress:
   ```
   go run . move <ID> in-progress
   ```

3. **When finishing a task**, move it to done:
   ```
   go run . move <ID> done
   ```

4. **When starting a new piece of work** that isn't already tracked, create a task:
   ```
   go run . create "Short descriptive title" --priority <low|medium|high|critical> --tags <layer-N>
   ```
   Then add a body with relevant context (reference to proposal docs, scope notes, etc.):
   ```
   go run . edit <ID> --body "Description of what needs to be done. See docs/plans/layer-N-xxx.md"
   ```

5. **When a task is blocked or no longer needed**, update accordingly:
   ```
   go run . move <ID> backlog
   go run . delete <ID>
   ```

### Conventions

- **Tags**: Use `layer-N` tags (e.g. `layer-3`, `layer-4`) to group tasks by roadmap layer.
- **Priorities**: Use `high` for tasks the user explicitly requested, `medium` for planned work, `low` for nice-to-haves.
- **Statuses**: `backlog` → `todo` → `in-progress` → `review` → `done`. Skip statuses when appropriate (e.g. `backlog` → `in-progress` is fine).
- **Task titles**: Short, imperative form (e.g. "Add WIP limits per column", not "WIP limits were added").
- Keep the board current -- move tasks as you work, don't let them go stale.

### Tracking Issues and Ideas

When you encounter problems or have ideas while using the tool, create tasks for them:

- **Bugs**: Something that doesn't work as expected.
  ```
  go run . create "Fix: <description of bug>" --priority high --tags bug
  ```
- **Ideas**: Usability improvements, missing features, or things that feel awkward.
  ```
  go run . create "<description of improvement>" --priority low --tags idea
  ```
- Always add a `--body` explaining what happened, what you expected, and (for bugs) how to reproduce.
- These tasks help us dogfood the tool and build a backlog of real-world improvements.
